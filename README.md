# Bitcetera Overlay for Gentoo Linux

This is a development overlay which contains a few ebuilds for Gentoo Linux.

Using them is as simple as one, two, three:

1. [Install Layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman)
2. Add this overlay with `layman -a bitcetera`
3. Emerge [any of these](https://github.com/svoop/bitcetera-overlay)

All ebuilds are in a flux and you use them at your own risk!
