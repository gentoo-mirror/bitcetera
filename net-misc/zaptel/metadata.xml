    Drivers for Digium and ZapataTelephony cards.

    Zaptel refers to Jim Dixon's open computer telephony hardware driver API. 
    Zaptel drivers were first released for BSD and Jim's Tormenta series of 
    DIY T1 interface cards. Digium later produced interface cards from Jim's 
    designs and improved the Zaptel drivers on the Linux platform. Digium 
    then added further drivers also following the Zaptel API for other 
    telephony hardware.

    The Zaptel project has been renamed to DAHDI as of version 2 upwards:
