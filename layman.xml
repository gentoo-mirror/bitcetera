      A bouquet of unreviewed ebuilds for Gentoo Linux maintained by 
      Bitcetera. This is the development overlay and thus should be
      considered experimental and edge, use at your own risk! Some of 
      the ebuilds are made available after review by Gentoo developers 
      as part of the Gentoo Sunrise Overlay. Please take a look at
      http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise/ for details.
